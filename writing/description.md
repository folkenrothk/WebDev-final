# CMPSC 302 Project Description

A group project with Annaliese Stone; The work will be committed in this repository until noted otherwise.

## Description

Inspired by my final for Computational Cultures, I propose that Annaliese and I create a website along with other functionality to present the information of a "gamer" project. The website would be designed to reflect the popular game streaming website of [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/). We plan to make a home page, two "streamer" profiles, and create a template video layout. If possible, we would like to use the content I have created for my Computational Cultures final (a video and artist statement). However, we can separate out the work to turn this in as a clean project for this course alone and use placeholders for where the content would have been.

The website that we are modeling after has some very interesting design choices with multiple grids, side bars, and a global style with some artistic differences within user profiles. Some features that we hope to include are automated pop-ups, "easter egg" content, and potentially a chat feature. This project will mostly be focused on layout, especially for the various screen sizes.

## Areas of development

Though my skills are temporally new, I am confident in my ability to complete this project. My general coding skills are strong. I am confident in my ability to code the basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript files. I will need to improve my design to match my proposed style. I plan to look into more complicated designs and functionality that will allow the user to interact with my website more. 

With some concepts for the features, I am excited to learn how to implement the pop-ups. These will use what I know in Javascript with SetTimeInterval and functions. I will need to expand my understanding of how to implement this within the design of our website without breaking other features. I am also invested in creating the "easter eggs" which will take my features from the CatChat assignment and expand upon them.

## Challenges

Of the many challenges that may arise during the process, I believe the first will be connecting what I imagine in my head to be conducted practically. While it is often my favorite thing to do, it is often difficult to translate creative plans into practical products. This project will hopefully be a balance of practicality while still allowing us to be creative.

Another challenge I will likely encounter is not only working in my strengths. This pairing for a group project is ideal but can also easily lead to us only coding our strengths. I would still like to push myself a bit and learn through the completion of this project.

Lastly, I will be challenged by the limitation of time. I often envision and plan for projects that cannot be completed by the deadline. I believe my unchanged vision from a solo coding venture to a group project will allow for us to complete these pieces on time. I also believe that we have a solid idea of what is necessary for this project and what can be added later if time permits.

## Ideal outcome

A successful outcome would be our website with an index and three connected pages. A balance between functionality and aesthetics will be important for us. 

We are planning to include some of the features we learned to make on prior assignments. From the Zen Gardens, we are planning to coordinate and create global styles and repetitive content while also allowing for unique styles within the profiles. The Simon Game inspiration will be seen in the functionality and style of the usable buttons and automated pop ups. Lastly, we are considering implementing some chat features like that CatChat to add complexity to our group project. Key-down event listeners may also be included with different functions to reveal "easter egg" content.

This project will be worthy to complete as it is a summation of our skills while still pushing each of us further. It is a criticism not only on gaming and streaming culture but also on the layout of Twitch.
