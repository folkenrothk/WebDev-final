# CMPSC 302 Project Update

Please provide responses to the following questions.

## Describe the progress you've made toward completing your project.

Kate and I have worked on setting up all of the pages we plan on including in our website.
We started by making mockups of our page layouts and sections we want to include on wireframe.cc (they're included in our writing folder). Then we divided up the work so that Kate got started on the template video/live-stream page, and I started on the home page and profile pages.
We currently have the basic HTML in all the pages, and we're just starting to flesh out the CSS on each of the pages as well.

## What areas are still challenging? What are some unforeseen issues that have arisen?

The difference in speed and style of how Kate and I code has been more interesting than difficult, but still a hurdle we didn't expect. Kate's much quicker at coming up with solutions for problems and errors, and I'm way too detailed for my own good occasionally. It's more an issue of me having to keep up, but that has yet to cause us any major difficulties.  
Another issue was the amount of basic set-up that we needed to agree upon before being able to code independently. Picking a color scheme that fits accessibility criteria, for example, is proving a challenge neither of us anticipated. It took a lot longer than we had planned for.

## Detail one success that you've achieved.

While I'm still making progress on the sidebar and navigation menu, Kate figured out how to get video embedded on the "livestream" page! Yay! Kate's not working on the pseudo-chat for the "stream."

## In what, if any, areas would you like additional assistance?
Most of our issues are in-house, - namely time management - but if we encounter any issues that arise we will let you know as soon as possible.
